                                    “In our R&D development researchers are constantly working to build a portfolio of products that serves patients. Our scientists ensure the quality and affordability of our products. R&D group has an exceptional track record in translating early drug opportunities into clinically-proven drug candidates by using cutting edge research in facility that is fully equipped to support both good laboratory practice (GLP) and current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations. Thanks to our research and development team, we have been expanding the drug product portfolio each year which includes solid oral dosage form products using dry blend, wet granulation, dry granulation and powders for reconstitution.
As our portfolio grows, we are proud of our ability to take a product through the entire development process from an idea through to delivering it safely to patients around the country.”
